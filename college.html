       <p style="background-color:black;color:white;text-align:center">
         Early in 1964,the enlightened public of Kanhangad and Nileshwar resolved to honour the memory 
         of Jawaharlal Nehru,the architect of modern India by undertaking educational and cultural activities
          in this educationally backward area.In pursuit of this idea, a dedicated and learned team set up in 1966,
          an educational society known as "<b>The Nehru Memorial Education Society</b>" under the distinguished presidentship of the 
          late <i>Shri.C.K.Nair</i> following which the society was duly registered.
